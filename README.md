**CodeRaiders** is a comprehensive online coding platform designed to empower developers of all skill levels. This platform offers a space to write and execute code, practice coding skills, and compete in coding contests.



## ✨ Features

### ⚔️ Coding Playground
- Write, compile, and execute code in a user-friendly editor.
- Support for at least one compiled language.
- Real-time error feedback and performance metrics.

### 🏋️‍♂️ Coding Arena
- Practice with pre-existing coding problems or upload new problems.
- Detailed problem descriptions, constraints, and test cases.
- Solutions can be tested against multiple test cases.

### 🎮 Coding Battleground
- Participate in ongoing contests and view real-time leaderboards.
- Create and host your own coding contests.

## 🛠️ Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts: **Client** and **Server**.

### 🌐 Client
- **Components**: Reusable React components used throughout the platform.
- **Hooks**: Custom React hooks for managing state and effects.
- **Pages**: Individual pages for different parts of the application, such as the home page, login, signup, practice, contests, etc.
- **Assets**: Static assets like images and styles.

```

│── src/
│   ├── assets/             
│   ├── Components/         
│   ├── Hooks/

│   ├── index.jsx           
│   └── ...                 
└── ...
```
### 🔧 Server
- **Codes**: Directory where user-submitted code is stored temporarily for execution.
- **Problems**: Contains JSON files that store coding problems and test cases.
- **Outputs**: Stores the outputs generated after code execution.
- **Scripts**: 
  - `addProblems.js`: Script for adding new problems to the platform.
  - `executeCodeFile.js`: Executes the user-submitted code against provided test cases.
  - `generateCodeFile.js`: Generates the code file from the user's input.

```
